	The Department of History, Aligarh Muslim University, is heir to the tradition established by the founder, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan. In the M.A.O. College, which preceded the University, careful attention was paid to the teaching of History. Sardar K.M. Panikker, the famous historian and statesman, was appointed Professor in History at the College and held that position when  <strong>the college was converted into the Aligarh Muslim University by the Act of 1920..</strong>
